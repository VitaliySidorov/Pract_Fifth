## Introduction to programming languages (seminars). </br>Lesson 5. Functions and one-dimensional arrays.

**Problem 34:** Define an array filled with random positive three-digit numbers. Write a program to show the number of even numbers in an array.
</br>[345, 897, 568, 234] -> 2

**Problem 36:** Define a one-dimensional array filled with random numbers. Find the sum of elements in odd positions.
</br>[3, 7, 23, 12] -> 19
</br>[-4, -6, 89, 6] -> 0

**Problem 38:** Specify an array of real numbers. Find the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array.
</br>[3 7 22 2 78] -> 76
